# Analysis-and-forecasting-of-road-accident-in-India

Traffic accidents are one of the foremost reasons for death and injuries around the world,
which is same for India as well. With increase number of populations of India, traffic
accidents will only get more vulnerable if not taken care right now. So, we want to prepare
people for the future by predicting results based on past records. We can use data
visualization tools to analyse and predict the vulnerability of travelling by any road based on
different aspects. Pointing out the accident reason data and the frequency of traffic collision
of road is analysed using correlation analysis and explained visualization techniques. We will
also try to provide methodology which can lead to improvement at the basic level. Analyse
and predict the vulnerability of roads in India based on measurements like weather condition,
vehicular defect, type of licence, age of driver and condition of roads. This study will
combine accident and some common reason of accident with their frequency of happening.

What â€“ Forecasting road accidents in India
Why- Prevention is always a better way to lower down the impact of any problem, which is
what I want to use for road accidents.
How- By providing correlation between different real-life factors we can predict the
vulnerability of any national highway or state highway. I will try to use Artificial Neural
Networks algorithms which will take the input as data sets and will help in classifying the
contribution of different parameters
